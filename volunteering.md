## TEALS AP CSP TA &mdash; Academic Year 2017
I was fortunate to be matched with a committed classroom teacher at
[Cascade High School](https://www.everettsd.org/cascade) in Everett. Over
the course of the year we've taken opportunities to enrich the code.org
curriculum with unplugged activities and additional material in addition to
the lab support model. Halfway through the year I also helped with the CS A
curriculum to fill in for a volunteer who needed to leave for a family emergency.
Next year I'll be working as a TA for the AP CS A curriculum with some of the
same students I worked with this year as a CSP TA.

## Seattle App Academy Coach &mdash; 2014 - 2017
Before volunteering with TEALS I worked as an after school coach with Seattle
App Academy. I started using Kodu and TouchDevelop to help kids build games.
Over time we added workshops using Arduino and Adafruit Trinket. Finally, I
developed curriculum using Sonic Pi to develop music composition workshops
that we offered both to the community and delivered in partnership with one of
the local Girl Scout troops.
