I'm Tyler. In the decade or so I've been writing software professionally
I've come across some ideas I think work well, from managing and developing
people, to directing work, to architecture and type systems (Fair warning:
  you probably shouldn't ask me about Monads).

Through my work with [TEALS](https://tealsk12.org) I've learned methods that
I've brought with me to work for coaching my teammates and allowing them
to learn from each other.

On teams, I try to lead by example, bring authenticity, sensitivity, and
transparency to my colleagues and lead by demonstrating my own fallibility and
frequently soliciting feedback from the people I'm supporting.

Outside of work and TEALS I'm a proud father with passions for music, cooking,
hiking, and diving.
